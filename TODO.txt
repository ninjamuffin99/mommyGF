Notes/ideas:
	-Maybe adjust the timer so that it's less time, or make mom slower a bit or something.
	
TODO:
	-Tweak the controls better, more specifically when you switch sides you kinda push
	-Fix mom tip drag and stuff
	
	-Maybe get some area randomization going? Not sure if stuff is confirmed yet
	-redo the spritesheets so that they are smaller in size and shit
	-add a simple highscore thing for finishing and timer
	-make it so when game is paused, the nape physics aren't still updating
	-Cheat Code system? Make it text based for more reliability on mobile
	-Better transition between playstate and anvil state
	-cleanup the PlayerAnims class to make it more versatile with more misc animations, but in the end I might just scrap it
	once i get final designs
