Notes/ideas:
	-Maybe adjust the timer so that it's less time, or make mom slower a bit or something.
	
TODO:
	
	-Maybe get some area randomization going? Not sure if stuff is confirmed yet
	-redo the spritesheets so that they are smaller in size and shit
	-add a simple highscore thing for finishing and timer
	-make it so when game is paused, the nape physics aren't still updating
	-Cheat Code system? Make it text based for more reliability on mobile
	-Better transition between playstate and anvil state
	-cleanup the PlayerAnims class to make it more versatile with more misc animations, but in the end I might just scrap it
	once i get final designs
	-cats have a set break for candy, about 5 or so
	-she needs to be harder to read
	-Make main menu options and stuff selector or something
	-fix cat hitting mom and something so that it's equal to one mom hit
	-add in the smear shit

	
	Today's TODO:
		-add in mom getting anvil dropped on her
		-mom moving more aggresively
		-fix mom hitbox

DONE?:
	-Have some indicator that shows slo mo mode and indicates when it's about to end
	-Fix the player position properly
	-Add end state that game goes to once rope breaks.
	-Fix mom hitbox, so that the cat interacts with the dynamic hitbox properly
	-Make candy pop up a bit, or have a better indicator of it coming to you
	-Rewrite controls code
	-Maybe swap the smack to another left button? like left to switch, then left to smack
	-removed points
	-Make a better pause screen, wit a slightly transparent bg or something
	-Modify the angle at which the normal walking transitions to stumbling
	-right now there isn't too much clarity regarding showing how fast mom is going, could be fixed with a background
	-replace points with a timer
	-Add bike kid
	-speed up motorcycle
	-add in bike sounds
	-add in animation of kid getting hit by bike
	-add in animation of kid picking up mom
	-Tweak the controls better, more specifically when you switch sides you kinda push
	-Fix cat spawn shit
	-change controls to Z to poke, and left/right to punch instead of up(did this but changed it back since it was stinky)
	-resize mom and player for optimization
